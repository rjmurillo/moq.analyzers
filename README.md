**Moq.Analyzers** is a Roslyn analyzer that helps you to write unit tests using the popular
[Moq](https://github.com/devlooped/moq) framework. Moq.Analyzers protects you from common mistakes and warns you if
something is wrong with your Moq configuration.

## Analyzer rules

* Moq1000: Sealed classes cannot be mocked
* Moq1001: Mocked interfaces cannot have constructor parameters
* Moq1002: Parameters provided into mock do not match any existing constructors
* Moq1100: Callback signature must match the signature of the mocked method
* Moq1101: SetupGet/SetupSet should be used for properties, not for methods
* Moq1200: Setup should be used only for overridable members
* Moq1201: Setup of async methods should use `.ReturnsAsync` instance instead of `.Result`
* Moq1300: Mock.As() should take interfaces
* Moq1400: Explicitly choose a mocking behavior instead of relying on the default (Loose) behavior
* Moq1410: Explicitly set the Strict mocking behavior

See [docs/rules](./docs/rules/README.md) for full documentation.

## Getting started
