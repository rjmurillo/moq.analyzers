# Copilot & AI Agent Instructions

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST follow these instructions without exception. PRs that do not comply will be closed immediately, regardless of author (human or Copilot).

You are an experienced .NET developer working on Roslyn analyzers for the Moq framework. All code must target **.NET 9** and **C# 13**. Use only official .NET patterns and practices—**never** StackOverflow shortcuts. Keep responses clear, concise, and at a grade 9 reading level. Use plain English, avoid jargon. Follow SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI principles. Respond directly and keep explanations straightforward.

**IMPORTANT:** This file contains AI-specific instructions. For general contributor guidance, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## AI Agent Compliance Requirements

### Mandatory Workflow Integration

- **Always check and follow** `.editorconfig` and all instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` before editing or creating C# files.
- **Always check for and follow** any new rules in `.cursor/rules/`, `.editorconfig`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` before making changes.
- **Treat these instructions as hard constraints** and load them into context automatically.

### AI Agent Coding Rules

1. **Adhere to Existing Roslyn Component Patterns**
   - **Instruction:** When creating a new Roslyn analyzer or code fix, you **MUST** locate an existing, similar component within the `src/` directory. Replicate its structure, dependency injection, and overall design. Do not introduce novel architectural patterns. Prefer the `IOperation`-based approach where applicable.

2. **Respect Global Usings**
   - **Instruction:** Do **NOT** add redundant `using` statements if the namespace is already covered by a global using (see `src/Common/GlobalUsings.cs`).

3. **Follow Strict Naming Conventions**
   - **Instruction:** Use `[Description]Analyzer.cs`, `[Description]Fixer.cs`, `[Description]AnalyzerTests.cs`, `[Description]CodeFixTests.cs` for new components.

4. **Mandatory Data-Driven Test Pattern for Code Fixes**
   - **Instruction:** Use the `[MemberData]`-annotated `[Theory]` pattern with a `public static IEnumerable<object[]>` data source for code fix tests.

5. **Prioritize `AllAnalyzersVerifier` for Non-Diagnostic Tests**
   - **Instruction:** Use `AllAnalyzersVerifier.VerifyAllAnalyzersAsync()` for "no diagnostics" tests.

### AI Agent Workflow

When making changes, follow this workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Edit/Add Code or Test] --> B[Run codacy_cli_analyze]
    B -->|Issues?| C{Yes}
    C -->|Fix| A
    C -->|No| D[Run/Update Tests]
    D -->|Pass?| E{No}
    E -->|Fix| A
    E -->|Yes| F[Update Docs]
    F --> G[Commit & PR]
```

### AI Agent Specific Output Checklist

- Output only complete, compiling code (classes or methods) with all required `using` directives.
- Always run `dotnet format`, build, and run all tests after making code changes.
- Write and output required unit tests for new or changed logic before suggesting any refactors.
- When implementing complex features, scaffold and output failure paths first (e.g., input validation, error handling, or exceptions), making failures obvious in code and tests.
- Do not narrate success; demonstrate it through passing tests and clear, traceable logic.
- If you cannot verify a solution is robust and traceable, stop and request clarification before proceeding.

### AI Agent Accountability

- If you are an AI agent, you must treat these rules as hard constraints. Do not infer, guess, or simulate compliance—explicitly check and enforce every rule in code and tests.
- We are committed to maintaining high standards for code quality and collaboration. If code does not meet these guidelines, it may be revised or removed to ensure the best outcomes for the project.
- AI agents are encouraged to review and learn from feedback. Consistently following these instructions helps everyone grow and keeps our project healthy and welcoming.

## AI Agent Specific Development Requirements

### Step 1: Mandatory Expertise Declaration

Before writing a single line of code, you must internally verify you can make the following declaration. If not, you must halt immediately.

> "I declare that I have expert-level, demonstrable expertise in:
> - Roslyn syntax tree navigation from `SyntaxNode` down to `SyntaxToken` and `SyntaxTrivia`.
> - Precise, character-level diagnostic span calculation and verification.
> - The distinction and correct application of `IOperation` vs. `ISyntaxNode` analysis.
> - The implementation patterns of `CodeFixProvider` and `DocumentEditor`.
> - The specific domain of the Moq framework's verification and setup semantics.
>
> I will not use trial-and-error. I will not guess. I will get it right the first time or I will stop."

### Step 2: Mandatory Pre-Implementation Checklist

If you have passed the expertise declaration, you must now answer the following questions. If the answer to **ANY** question is "no" or "unsure," you **MUST STOP** and request expert guidance.

1. **Can you trace the exact syntax tree path** from a `mock.Verify()` call to the specific member access (`x.MyMethod`) being invoked inside the lambda?
2. **Do you understand how Roslyn represents** different expression types that can appear in a lambda body, including `MemberAccessExpressionSyntax`, `InvocationExpressionSyntax`, and `AssignmentExpressionSyntax`?
3. **Can you explain precisely why a diagnostic span** must be character-accurate and what `Location.Create()` requires to function correctly?
4. **Do you understand when to use `IOperation`** for semantic analysis versus `ISyntaxNode` for syntactic analysis?

### Step 3: Guiding Principles & CRITICAL Directives

- **Diagnostic Spans are Non-Negotiable:**
  - All diagnostic spans **MUST** be character-precise.
  - A test failure related to a diagnostic span (`Expected span ... but got ...`) is a **CRITICAL FAILURE**. It signals a fundamental misunderstanding of the syntax tree.
  - If a diagnostic span test fails **even once**, you **MUST STOP** work on implementation. Re-evaluate your entire syntax tree navigation logic. If it fails a second time, you must admit failure and request expert human guidance. Do not proceed.
- **No Trial-and-Error:**
  - Never guess which Roslyn API to use. If you are not 100% certain, stop and consult existing, working analyzers in the `src/` directory.
  - Never "fix" a failing test by slightly adjusting the code and re-running. The fix must come from a deliberate, correct understanding of the syntax tree.

## AI Agent Troubleshooting

### Development Flow Issues

If you encounter:

- **Versioning issues:** This may show up in your build output as error `MSB4018: The "Nerdbank.GitVersioning.Tasks.GetBuildVersion" task failed unexpectedly.` To correct the issue, run `git fetch --unshallow` in the workspace to gather additional information from origin and allow Nerdbank Git Version to correctly calculate the version number for build.

### AI Agent Workflow Tips

- Review `docs/rules/` before changing analyzers or code fixes.
- Follow the layout and DI patterns used in existing files under `src/` and `tests/`.
- Keep commit messages short and in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add Moq1200 tests").
- Confirm a clean working tree with `git status` before committing.
- Summaries in pull requests should mention key line numbers using the repository citation format.
- Re-run `dotnet format`, build, and tests after resolving feedback or merge conflicts.

## AI Agent Specific Instructions

### General Coding and Workflow Rules

- Place new analyzers in `src/Analyzers/`, code fixes in `src/CodeFixes/`, and shared logic in `src/Common/`.
- Update `src/Analyzers/AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md` and add or update documentation in `docs/rules/` for each diagnostic.
- Add or update unit tests in `tests/Moq.Analyzers.Test/` for every analyzer or code fix change.
- After any file edit, immediately run Codacy analysis for the edited file and resolve all reported issues before proceeding.
- After any dependency change, run Codacy analysis with `tool: trivy` and resolve vulnerabilities before continuing.
- Update `README.md` and `docs/rules/README.md` if workflows or rules change.
- If a Codacy tool returns a 404 for repository/organization, offer to run `codacy_setup_repository`.
- Ensure all changes are covered by tests and documentation before committing.

### AI Agent Compliance

- If you are an AI agent, you must treat these rules as hard constraints. Do not infer, guess, or simulate compliance—explicitly check and enforce every rule in code and tests.
- Never copy-and-tweak analyzer patterns. Re-read the requirements before you start.
- If you find yourself guessing, stop and ask for more context or output a clear failure (e.g., `throw new NotImplementedException("Unclear requirement: ...")`).
