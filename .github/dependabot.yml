  # NuGet dependency management is handled by Renovate (see renovate.json).
  # Dependabot NuGet PRs were disabled because:
  #   1. PR titles use "Bump X from A to B" format, which fails the required
  #      "Validate PR title" check (conventional commits required).
  #   2. Both bots created duplicate PRs for every package update.
  #   3. Renovate supports better grouping, automerge rules, and conventional
  #      commit formatting out of the box.
