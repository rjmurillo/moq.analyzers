# XML File Instructions (Quick Reference)

- **Read this file before editing any .xml file**
- **Cross-reference with related instruction files**
- **Complete the Validation Checklist before submitting**
- **Stop and request help if uncertain**

## Context Loading for Copilot

When working on this file type, you MUST:
1. Read this entire instruction file before making any changes
2. Cross-reference with related instruction files (listed below)
3. Validate your understanding by checking the "Validation Checklist" section
4. If uncertain about any requirement, stop and request clarification

**Related Instruction Files:**
- [project.instructions.md](project.instructions.md) - For project and build configuration
- [csharp.instructions.md](csharp.instructions.md) - For C# code changes
- [text.instructions.md](text.instructions.md) - For plain text documentation

## Validation Checklist

Before submitting any changes, verify:

**XML Quality & Documentation:**
- [ ] XML syntax is valid
- [ ] Schema compliance is maintained
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Changes work as expected

**Process:**
- [ ] Conventional commit format used
- [ ] PR description includes validation evidence
- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced (or documented if necessary)

## Decision Trees

### When to Request Human Review
- Is this a new XML schema or documentation standard? → Yes → Request expert guidance
- Is this a breaking change to XML structure or documentation? → Yes → Document thoroughly and request review
- Are you uncertain about XML schema or documentation? → Yes → Stop and request guidance

### When to Stop and Ask for Help
- Uncertain about XML requirements
- Major changes to project configuration
- Security or legal implications

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**DO NOT:**
- Skip validation steps
- Submit changes without validation evidence

**ALWAYS:**
- Read the entire instruction file first
- Validate all XML and documentation changes
- Include comprehensive documentation updates
- Document all changes thoroughly

## Context Management

**Before Starting:**
- Read the complete instruction file
- Understand the current file's purpose and structure
- Identify all related files that may need updates

**During Editing:**
- Keep track of all changes made
- Validate each change against requirements
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns

**After Completing:**
- Review all changes against the validation checklist
- Ensure all requirements are met
- Prepare comprehensive PR description with evidence

## Handling Uncertainty

**Stop and Request Help When:**
- You cannot explain your approach clearly
- You're making "educated guesses" about XML or documentation
- You're uncertain about project configuration
- You cannot trace the logic in XML without narration

**Escalation Process:**
1. Stop all work immediately
2. Document what you were trying to accomplish
3. Explain what specific aspect is unclear
4. Request expert guidance with specific questions
5. Do not proceed until you have clear, confident understanding

## Success Criteria

Your changes are successful when:
- All XML and documentation validation checks pass
- PR description is complete and accurate
- All checklist items completed
- No automated bot feedback ignored

## XML Standards

### XML Formatting Requirements

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Follow XML schema standards where applicable
- Ensure valid XML syntax
- Use descriptive element and attribute names
- Maintain consistent structure across similar files

### XML File Types in Repository

This repository contains several types of XML files:

1. **Project files** - MSBuild project configurations
2. **Documentation files** - XML documentation for APIs
3. **Configuration files** - Various configuration settings
4. **Resource files** - Localization and resource management

## Documentation Standards

### XML Documentation Requirements

**Required for all public APIs:**

- **Use `<see cref=".." />` tags for all type references** instead of plain text
  - ✅ Good: `<see cref="Task{T}"/>` or `<see cref="MoqKnownSymbols"/>`
  - ❌ Bad: `Task<T>` or `MoqKnownSymbols`
- **Use `<see langword=".." />` for C# keywords**
  - ✅ Good: `<see langword="true"/>` or `<see langword="null"/>`
  - ❌ Bad: `true` or `null`
- **Use `<paramref name=".." />` for parameter references**
  - ✅ Good: `<paramref name="mockedMemberSymbol"/>`
  - ❌ Bad: `mockedMemberSymbol`
- **Use `<c>..</c>` for inline code snippets**
  - ✅ Good: `<c>x => x.Method()</c>`
  - ❌ Bad: `x => x.Method()`

**Examples:**
```xml
/// <summary>
/// Determines whether a member symbol is either overridable or represents a 
/// <see cref="Task{T}"/>/<see cref="ValueTask{T}"/> Result property
/// that Moq allows to be setup even if the underlying <see cref="Task{T}"/> 
/// property is not overridable.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="mockedMemberSymbol">The mocked member symbol.</param>
/// <param name="knownSymbols">A <see cref="MoqKnownSymbols"/> instance for resolving well-known types.</param>
/// <returns>
/// Returns <see langword="true"/> when the member is overridable or is a 
/// <see cref="Task{T}"/>/<see cref="ValueTask{T}"/> Result property; 
/// otherwise <see langword="false" />.
/// </returns>
```

**Validation:**
- All public APIs must have complete XML documentation
- All type references must use `<see cref=".." />` tags
- All C# keywords must use `<see langword=".." />` tags
- Documentation must be accurate and up-to-date

## Project Configuration
