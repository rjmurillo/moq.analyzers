When working on this file type, you MUST:
1. Read this entire instruction file before making any changes
2. Cross-reference with related instruction files (listed below)
3. Validate your understanding by checking the "Validation Checklist" section
4. If uncertain about any requirement, stop and request clarification

**Related Instruction Files:**
- [project.instructions.md](project.instructions.md) - For project and build configuration
- [json.instructions.md](json.instructions.md) - For configuration files

## Validation Checklist

Before submitting any changes, verify:

**Workflow & Security:**
- [ ] YAML syntax is valid
- [ ] All workflow requirements met
- [ ] Security scan completed after dependency changes
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

**Process:**
- [ ] Conventional commit format used
- [ ] PR description includes validation evidence
- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced (or documented if necessary)

## Decision Trees

### When to Request Human Review
- Is this a new CI/CD workflow? → Yes → Request expert guidance
- Is this a breaking change to workflow or security? → Yes → Document thoroughly and request review
- Are you uncertain about workflow or security requirements? → Yes → Stop and request guidance

### When to Stop and Ask for Help
- Uncertain about workflow or security requirements
- Major changes to CI/CD process
- Security or legal implications

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**DO NOT:**
- Skip validation steps
- Ignore security scanning after dependency changes
- Submit changes without validation evidence

**ALWAYS:**
- Read the entire instruction file first
- Validate all workflow and security changes
- Include comprehensive documentation updates
- Document all changes thoroughly

## Context Management

**Before Starting:**
- Read the complete instruction file
- Understand the current file's purpose and structure
- Identify all related files that may need updates

**During Editing:**
- Keep track of all changes made
- Validate each change against requirements
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns

**After Completing:**
- Review all changes against the validation checklist
- Ensure all requirements are met
- Prepare comprehensive PR description with evidence

## Handling Uncertainty

**Stop and Request Help When:**
- You cannot explain your approach clearly
- You're making "educated guesses" about workflow or security
- You're uncertain about CI/CD process
- You cannot trace the logic in workflow without narration

**Escalation Process:**
1. Stop all work immediately
2. Document what you were trying to accomplish
3. Explain what specific aspect is unclear
4. Request expert guidance with specific questions
5. Do not proceed until you have clear, confident understanding

## Success Criteria

Your changes are successful when:
- All workflow and security validation checks pass
- Security scan is clean
- PR description is complete and accurate
- All checklist items completed
- No automated bot feedback ignored

## CI/CD Workflow Requirements

### Workflow Configuration Standards

- Use consistent YAML formatting and indentation
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Ensure proper workflow syntax
- Use descriptive job and step names
- Maintain consistent structure across workflows

### CI Workflow Requirements

When making CI/CD changes:

1. **Test locally first**: Ensure workflows run successfully locally
2. **Include validation evidence**: Provide logs or screenshots showing successful execution
3. **Update documentation**: Document new CI features or changes
4. **Consider performance impact**: Ensure changes don't significantly impact CI duration

### Workflow Validation

Before submitting CI/CD changes:

1. **Syntax Validation**: Ensure YAML syntax is correct
2. **Local Testing**: Test workflows locally when possible
3. **Performance Impact**: Assess impact on CI duration
4. **Security Review**: Ensure no security vulnerabilities are introduced
5. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation

## Performance Testing Guidelines

### When Performance Testing is Required

- New analyzers or fixers
- Changes to existing analyzer logic
- Dependency updates that might affect performance
- CI/CD changes that impact build times

### Performance Testing Process

1. Run benchmarks locally using `dotnet run --project tests/Moq.Analyzers.Benchmarks/`
2. Compare results against baseline
3. Document any performance regressions or improvements
4. Include benchmark results in PR description

### Performance Validation Evidence

- Benchmark output showing no significant regressions
- Comparison with previous baseline results
- Explanation of any performance changes

## Security Considerations

### Security Scanning Requirements

- **All dependency updates require security scanning**
- Run Trivy scan after dependency changes
- Address any security vulnerabilities before merging
- Document security implications in PR description

### Security Workflow Configuration

- Configure security scanning in CI/CD workflows
- Set up automated vulnerability detection
- Ensure proper security reporting
- Configure security alerts and notifications

## Code Quality Standards

### Required Checks

Before submitting a PR, ensure your changes pass all quality checks:

1. **YAML Validation**: Ensure valid YAML syntax
2. **Workflow Testing**: Test workflows locally when possible
3. **Performance Impact**: Assess impact on CI duration
4. **Security Review**: Ensure no security vulnerabilities
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### YAML-Specific Requirements

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Follow YAML best practices
- Ensure proper syntax and structure
- Use descriptive names for jobs, steps, and variables
- Maintain consistent formatting across workflows

## Git Commit Messages

### Guidelines

1. **Capitalization and Punctuation**: Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation. If using Conventional Commits, remember to use all lowercase.
2. **Mood**: Use imperative mood in the subject line.
3. **Type of Commit**: Specify the type of commit using conventional commit types.
4. **Length**: The first line should ideally be no longer than 50 characters, and the body should be restricted to 72 characters.
5. **Content**: Be direct, try to eliminate filler words and phrases.

### Conventional Commits

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

- Update documentation for new workflows
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add performance benchmarks for new workflows
- Clarify PR description or validation evidence

**PRs That May Be Rejected:**
- Missing validation evidence

## Formatting and Linting

- **You must address all feedback from automated bots** (e.g., YAML linters, formatting bots) as you would human reviewers.
- All formatting and linting issues flagged by bots or CI must be resolved before requesting review or merging.
- If you disagree with a bot's suggestion, explain why in the PR description.
- If a bot's feedback is not addressed and a human reviewer must repeat the request, the PR will be closed until all automated feedback is resolved.

## Workflow Best Practices

### GitHub Actions Guidelines

- Use reusable workflows where appropriate
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Use appropriate triggers for workflows
- Configure proper permissions for jobs
- Use caching to improve performance

### Workflow Security

- Use minimal required permissions
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in workflows
