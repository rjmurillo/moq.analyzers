# C# File Instructions

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST follow these instructions when editing any C# file in this repository.

- **For complex changes, see the Decision Trees section below**

**MANDATORY: Only Valid C# Code in All Tests**

> **You MUST NEVER write or include code in analyzer or code fix tests that produces C# compiler errors.**
> - All test code must be valid, compilable C#.
> - Do not write tests for static, const, readonly, or event members if the code would not compile.
> - Do not include code that triggers CSxxxx errors (e.g., invalid member access, missing members, or illegal syntax).
> - If a scenario cannot be expressed as valid C#, it is not a valid test case for analyzers or code fixes.
> - Any test that fails to compile is an immediate failure and must be removed or rewritten.

**Rationale:**
- Roslyn analyzers and code fixes only operate on valid, successfully parsed C# code. Compiler errors prevent analyzers from running and invalidate the test scenario.
- Writing invalid code in tests causes build failures, test failures, and wastes review/CI resources.
- This is a non-negotiable rule. If you are unsure whether a test is valid C#, STOP and request expert guidance.

## Primary Instructions

Always read and apply the instructions in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) when working on C# source or project files.

## Additional Context

This instruction file works in conjunction with the comprehensive C# development guidelines in the main copilot-instructions.md file. The main file contains detailed requirements for:

- Roslyn analyzer development
- Code quality standards
- Testing requirements
- Performance considerations
- XML documentation standards
- Workflow requirements

## File-Specific Requirements

When working with C# files, ensure you also review:

- **Project files**: See [project.instructions.md](project.instructions.md) for .csproj and .sln files
- **XML files**: See [xml.instructions.md](xml.instructions.md) for XML documentation and configuration
- **Documentation**: See [markdown.instructions.md](markdown.instructions.md) for documentation updates

## Maintenance Note

If you update guidance in copilot-instructions.md that affects C# development, ensure consistency across all related instruction files.

## Decision Trees for Complex Scenarios

### Multi-File/Feature Change Flowchart

1. **Identify all affected file types**
2. **For each file type:**
   - Locate and read the corresponding instruction file
   - Note any validation, documentation, or escalation requirements
3. **Plan the change:**
   - List all files to be edited
   - Determine order of operations (e.g., code first, then docs, then config)
   - Identify dependencies between files
4. **Edit files in logical order**
5. **After each file edit:**
   - Run required validation (build, test, lint, etc.)
   - Document evidence as required
6. **After all edits:**
   - Re-run all tests and validations
   - Update documentation and release notes as needed
   - Prepare a comprehensive PR description with evidence for each file type
7. **If blocked or uncertain at any step:**
   - Escalate by tagging @repo-maintainers

### Introducing a New Analyzer or Code Fix Flowchart

1. **Read csharp.instructions.md and project.instructions.md**
2. **Scaffold the new analyzer/fixer in the correct directory**
3. **Add or update unit tests (see test instructions)**
4. **Update documentation:**
   - Add/modify rule docs in docs/rules/
   - Update AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md
5. **Update project files if needed**
6. **Run all validations (build, test, lint, Codacy, etc.)**
7. **Validate code coverage of your changed code**
8. **Prepare PR with validation evidence for each file type**
9. **If any diagnostic span or test fails more than once, STOP and escalate**
10. **If uncertain about Roslyn APIs, Moq semantics, or workflow, escalate**

## Diagnostic Investigation for Analyzer Failures

### When Symbol-Based Detection Tests Fail

If tests fail after adding/modifying symbol-based detection:

1. **Create Temporary Diagnostic Test:**
```csharp
[TestMethod]
public async Task DiagnosticSymbolTest()
{
    string code = """
        var mock = new Mock<ITestInterface>();
        mock.Setup(x => x.Method()).Raises(x => x.Event += null, EventArgs.Empty);
        """;
    
    var (compilation, semanticModel, invocation) = await GetSemanticInfo(code);
    var symbolInfo = semanticModel.GetSymbolInfo(invocation);
    
    // Output actual symbol type to understand what's missing
    Console.WriteLine($"Symbol: {symbolInfo.Symbol?.ContainingType}");
}
```

2. **Compare Against Registry:** Check if symbol type exists in `MoqKnownSymbols`
3. **Add Missing Symbol:** Register in `MoqKnownSymbols` with proper generic arity
4. **Delete Diagnostic Test:** Always clean up temporary investigation code

### Common Symbol Detection Issues

- **Generic vs Non-Generic**: `IRaise<T>` (generic) â‰  `IRaiseable` (non-generic)
- **Method Chain Returns**: Different interfaces at each chain position
- **Missing Symbol Registration**: String fallback masks missing symbols

## Test Data & Sample Inputs/Outputs

### What Constitutes Good Test Data?
- Cover all code paths: positive, negative, and edge cases
- Include both minimal and complex/realistic examples
- Test for invalid inputs, exceptions, and boundary conditions
- Include performance-sensitive scenarios if relevant
- For analyzers/code fixes: test all diagnostic locations, fix applications, and no-fix scenarios

### Coverage Strategy
- For every new analyzer/code fix, include:
  - At least one positive, one negative, and one edge case test
  - Data-driven tests for all fixable patterns
  - Performance test if analyzer is non-trivial
- Document test data rationale in comments or PR description
- Code coverage is automatically generated when `dotnet test --settings ./build/targets/tests/test.runsettings` is run and placed in `./artifacts/TestResults/coverage/Cobertura.xml`
