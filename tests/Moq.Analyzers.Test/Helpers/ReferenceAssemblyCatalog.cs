/// <summary>
/// The testing framework does heavy work to resolve references for set of <see cref="ReferenceAssemblies"/>, including potentially
/// running the NuGet client to download packages. This class caches the ReferenceAssemblies class (which is thread-safe), so that
/// package resolution only happens once for a given configuration.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// It would be more straightforward to pass around ReferenceAssemblies instances directly, but using non-primitive types causes
/// Visual Studio's Test Explorer to collapse all test cases down to a single entry, which makes it harder to see which test cases
/// are failing or debug a single test case.
