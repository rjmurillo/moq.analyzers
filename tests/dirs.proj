<Project Sdk="Microsoft.Build.Traversal">
  <!--
    Recursively build dirs.proj files in child directories

    DO NOT use a double-asterisk (**) wildcard here, as that
    will cause the traversal to bypass the per-component dirs.proj
    files and reach into descendants directly. This is not what we want.

    We want each top-level component to control what / how things get built.
