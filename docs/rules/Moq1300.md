# Moq1300: `Mock.As()` should take interfaces only

The `.As()` method is used when a mocked object must implement multiple interfaces. It cannot be used with abstract or
concrete classes. To fix:

- Change the method to use an interface
- Remove the `.As()` method

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
interface ISampleInterface
{
    int Calculate(int a, int b);
}

class SampleClass
{
    int Calculate() => 0;
}

var mock = new Mock<SampleClass>()
    .As<SampleClass>(); // Moq1300: Mock.As() should take interfaces only
```

## Solution

```csharp
interface ISampleInterface
{
    int Calculate(int a, int b);
}

class SampleClass
{
    int Calculate() => 0;
}

var mock = new Mock<ISampleInterface>();
```

### Known Limitation: Generic Type Parameters

> **Note:** This limitation is under investigation ([#756](https://github.com/rjmurillo/moq.analyzers/issues/756)). Future versions may provide better support for generic type parameters.

Moq1300 currently fires for generic type parameters constrained to interfaces:

```csharp
void SetupMyMock<T>(Mock<IFoo> mock, Action<Mock<T>> setupStuff) 
    where T : IFoo
{
    // Moq1300 fires here, even though T is constrained to IFoo
    setupStuff(mock.As<T>());
}
```

#### Why This Happens

C# generic constraints cannot enforce "interface-only" requirements. While `where T : IFoo` ensures `T` implements the interface, it doesn't prevent `T` from being a class:

```csharp
class Foo : IFoo { }  // Satisfies the constraint

void Use()
{
    var mock = new Mock<Foo>();
    SetupMyMock(mock, foo => { /* ... */ });  // Compiles, but fails at runtime
}
```

Because `Mock.As<T>()` only works with interfaces, the analyzer **errs on the side of safety** and reports this as an error to prevent potential runtime failures.

#### Current Workaround

If you control all call sites and can guarantee `T` will always be an interface type, you may suppress this diagnostic:

```csharp
void SetupMyMock<T>(Mock<IFoo> mock, Action<Mock<T>> setupStuff) 
    where T : IFoo
{
#pragma warning disable Moq1300
    setupStuff(mock.As<T>());
#pragma warning restore Moq1300
}
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Only suppress this diagnostic if:

- You control all call sites and verify `T` is always an interface
- The helper method is internal to your test project with limited, verified usage
- You have integration tests that validate all generic patterns

**Do not suppress if:**

- The helper is in a public library or shared test infrastructure
- Call sites are outside your control
- Runtime failures would be difficult to diagnose or impact many tests

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to
your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable Moq1300
var mock = new Mock<SampleClass>()
    .As<SampleClass>(); // Moq1300: Mock.As() should take interfaces only
#pragma warning restore Moq1300
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none`
in the
[configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.Moq1300.severity = none
```
