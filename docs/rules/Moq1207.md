## Cause

This rule is triggered when `SetupSequence` is used on non-overridable members.

## Rule description

SetupSequence should only be used for members that can be overridden. This includes:

- Virtual and abstract members
- Interface members
- Members that override virtual or abstract members (and are not sealed)

Non-overridable members include:
- Non-virtual methods and properties
- Static members
- Sealed members
- Fields

This rule helps prevent runtime exceptions when Moq cannot intercept calls to non-overridable members. According to the [Moq documentation](https://github.com/devlooped/moq/wiki/Quickstart#customizing-mock-behavior), Moq can only mock virtual members, interface members, and abstract members.

## How to fix violations

Make the member virtual, abstract, or part of an interface. Alternatively, use a different testing approach that doesn't require mocking non-overridable members.

## Examples

### Violates

```csharp
public class SampleClass
{
    public int NonVirtualProperty { get; set; } // Non-virtual property
    public int NonVirtualMethod() => 42;       // Non-virtual method
    public int Field;                          // Field
}

var mock = new Mock<SampleClass>();

// These will trigger Moq1207
mock.SetupSequence(x => x.NonVirtualProperty);
mock.SetupSequence(x => x.NonVirtualMethod());
mock.SetupSequence(x => x.Field);
```

### Does not violate

```csharp
public interface ISampleInterface
{
    int InterfaceProperty { get; set; }
    int InterfaceMethod();
}

public class SampleClass
{
    public virtual int VirtualProperty { get; set; }
    public virtual int VirtualMethod() => 42;
}

var interfaceMock = new Mock<ISampleInterface>();
var classMock = new Mock<SampleClass>();

// These are valid
interfaceMock.SetupSequence(x => x.InterfaceProperty);
interfaceMock.SetupSequence(x => x.InterfaceMethod());
classMock.SetupSequence(x => x.VirtualProperty);
classMock.SetupSequence(x => x.VirtualMethod());
```
