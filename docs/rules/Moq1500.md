# Moq1301: Mock.Get() should not take literals

`Mock.Get()` is used to retrieve the Mock instance associated with a mocked object. It should not be called with literal values because literals cannot have mock instances associated with them.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
var mock = Mock.Get("literal string"); // Moq1301: Mock.Get() should not take literals
var mock = Mock.Get(42); // Moq1301: Mock.Get() should not take literals
var mock = Mock.Get(null); // Moq1301: Mock.Get() should not take literals
```

## Solution

Use `Mock.Get()` with actual mocked objects instead of literals:

```csharp
var mockObject = new Mock<IMyInterface>().Object;
var mock = Mock.Get(mockObject); // Correct usage
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to
your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable Moq1301
var mock = Mock.Get("literal string"); // Moq1301: Mock.Get() should not take literals
#pragma warning restore Moq1301
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none`
in the
[configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.Moq1301.severity = none
```
