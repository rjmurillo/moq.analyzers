title: Verify should be used only for overridable members

Moq works by creating a dynamic proxy class at runtime. This proxy inherits from the class being mocked and overrides its `virtual` or `abstract` members. This allows Moq to intercept calls and implement mocking behavior, including verification.

Because of this design, Moq can only intercept calls to members that are overridable:

- Members of an interface (which are implicitly virtual).
- `virtual` or `abstract` members of a non-sealed class.

Non-virtual members cannot be overridden in a subclass due to how the .NET CLR works. Consequently, Moq's proxy cannot intercept calls to them. Attempting to `Verify` a non-virtual member will result in a `System.NotSupportedException` at runtime, with a message like "Non-overridable members ... may not be used in setup / verification expressions."

This analyzer helps you avoid this runtime error by identifying `Verify` calls on non-overridable members at compile time.

To fix this issue, you must ensure the member you are verifying can be overridden:

- If mocking a class, mark the member as `virtual`.
- Prefer mocking an interface instead of a concrete class.

## How to fix

Ensure that `Verify` is used only with virtual, abstract, or interface members.

## Example

The following code would be flagged by this analyzer because `MyMethod` is not
overridable:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public int MyMethod()
    {
        return 1;
    }
}

var mock = new Mock<MyClass>();
mock.Verify(x => x.MyMethod());
```

To fix this, you can make the method `virtual`:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public virtual int MyMethod()
    {
        return 1;
    }
}

var mock = new Mock<MyClass>();
mock.Verify(x => x.MyMethod());
```

## Solution

```csharp
class SampleClass
{
    virtual int Property { get; set; }
    virtual int VirtualMethod() => 0;
}

var mock = new Mock<SampleClass>();
mock.Verify(x => x.Property);
mock.Verify(x => x.VirtualMethod());
mock.VerifyGet(x => x.Property);
mock.VerifySet(x => x.Property = 42);
mock.VerifyNoOtherCalls(); // This method doesn't verify specific members, so it's always valid
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to
your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable Moq1210
mock.Verify(x => x.Property); // Moq1210: Verify should be used only for overridable members
#pragma warning restore Moq1210
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none`
in the
[configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.Moq1210.severity = none
```
